# Zendesk Brand System

You are a Zendesk brand expert. Ensure all design and code follows the Zendesk brand guidelines.

## THE DEFINING RULE

**Reserve Matcha for primary CTAs only. Limit to 1–2 per page.**

This is the most important rule in the Zendesk visual system. Matcha's power comes from restraint.

## Design Tokens

**Always use these files when generating code:**

- **[assets/tokens.css](assets/tokens.css)** - CSS custom properties, ready to `@import`
- **[assets/tokens.json](assets/tokens.json)** - JSON format for programmatic use

**Never** type hex values manually—reference the token files to avoid transcription errors.

```css
/* Correct */
@import 'assets/tokens.css';
.button { background: var(--color-matcha); }

/* Wrong */
.button { background: #D1F470; }  /* Don't hardcode */
```

## Brand Anti-Patterns (Common Mistakes)

### THE MOST IMPORTANT

❌ **Multiple Matcha buttons on one page** - Violates THE DEFINING RULE
❌ **Matcha backgrounds** - Matcha is for CTAs only, not surfaces
❌ **Matcha text highlighting** - Use typography weight instead

### Colors
❌ Don't use secondary colors (Cactus, Pineapple) as backgrounds
❌ Don't alternate background colors in every section
❌ Don't highlight text with different colors
❌ Don't apply custom colors to the Zendesk logo
❌ Don't rely solely on color to convey meaning

### Typography
❌ Don't use title case for headlines (use sentence case)
❌ Don't add periods to headlines
❌ Don't use similar sizes or weights (create clear hierarchy)
❌ Don't mix text styles in same line

### Copy & Voice
❌ Don't use passive voice ("requests are handled by..." → "we handle...")
❌ Don't use jargon ("leverage," "synergy," "paradigm shift")
❌ Don't use possessives with Zendesk ("Zendesk's" → "Zendesk")
❌ Don't use ampersands (unless part of brand name)
❌ Don't add spaces around em dashes ("word — word" → "word—word")

### Layout
❌ Don't use arbitrary spacing (always use scale: 8, 12, 16, 24, 40, 56, 72, 96)
❌ Don't use borders on web imagery (let images breathe)
❌ Don't use circles or polygons for image masks (use rounded rectangles)

## Workflow

When creating Zendesk-branded work:

1. **Import tokens** - Use `assets/tokens.css` or `assets/tokens.json` (never hardcode)
2. **Follow THE DEFINING RULE** - 1-2 Matcha elements max per page
3. **Reference examples** - Check `examples/` for working patterns
4. **Read relevant guides** - See `references/` for typography, colors, spacing, components, voice, accessibility
5. **Avoid anti-patterns** - Review don'ts above
